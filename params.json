{"name":"Tracker","tagline":"A simple REST interface for uploading and viewing GPS coordinates. To be used in conjunction with a client app.","body":"# A simple system for recording location data\r\nThis system includes both a RESTful API to upload location data and the web pages used to view them. It was designed as a means to track users as they run/cycle and should be used in conjunction with a smartphone app to upload the GPS data.\r\n\r\n##SQLite\r\nAll data is stored in an SQLite database so there is no need to create and maintain MySQL (or similar) databases.\r\n\r\n##Map viewer\r\nThe project includes a viewer allowing spectators to locate the user, this uses the [Google Maps JavaScript v3 API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) to display the current location and is updated periodically with AJAX calls.\r\n\r\n#How it works\r\n\r\n##Initialization\r\nFirst you need to make a call to `init.php` to register the device and initialize the database. The call will look something like this:\r\n\r\n`/api/init.php?down=test&reset=1&device=abc123`\r\n\r\n* `down` is the friendly name that people will use to access the tracking information\r\n* `reset` should be set to `1` to clear all previous data for this download key, `0` if you don't want to clear\r\n* device is the device ID that prevents others from hijacking the tracking. This should be a random string that remains constant for each device.\r\n\r\nThe response from this will be a JSON string that looks like this:\r\n\r\n    {\"success\":true,\r\n    \"key\":\"SrQWD1KxxZOUMRO\",\r\n    \"device\":\"abc123\"}\r\n* `success` is set to `true` if the initialization has worked, `false` otherwise\r\n* `key` is the upload key that is used to add data to the database, this should remain secret, there is no need for the user to be aware of it\r\n* `device` is the ID of the device making the request","google":"UA-61495344-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
